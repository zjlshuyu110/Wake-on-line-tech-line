# Wake-on-Line Tech Line

This is a temporary record for my configuration progress for my tech line: Wake on Line.

## Inspiration

The idea was inspired by remote PC start-up techniques. More information can be found here:
- [Google Search on How to Remotely Start a PC](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+remotely+start+a+PC)

## Basic Introduction

For a basic introduction to this technology, refer to:
- [Wake-on-LAN on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN)

## Start Guide

### A. Reading Part

Here are some resources to get started:

1. [PCMag UK - How to Turn On Your Computer From Across the House With Wake-on-LAN](https://uk.pcmag.com/networking/137906/how-to-turn-on-your-computer-from-across-the-house-with-wake-on-lan)
2. [The Tech Edvocate - How to Remotely Turn On Your PC Over the Internet](https://www.thetechedvocate.org/how-to-remotely-turn-on-your-pc-over-the-internet/)
3. [HowToGeek - How to Remotely Turn On Your PC Over the Internet](https://www.howtogeek.com/192642/how-to-remotely-turn-on-your-pc-over-the-internet/)
4. [HowToGeek - How to Forward Ports on Your Router](https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/)

### B. Configuration Part

Steps for configuration:

1. **Check the IP Address**: Determine if it's dynamic or static. [Guide on How to Get a Static IP Address on a Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/static-ip-address-windows-pc/)
2. **Configure Router Settings**: Access router settings at [TPLink Router Settings](http://tplinkwifi.net/)

### Additional Ideas

- Connecting to a local VPN for added security.
- Use dynamic IP addressing.
- Consider using TeamViewer, which also supports WOL (Wake-on-LAN) but might be based on VPN technology and require payment.
